## Weapons and Action Points
Weapons have two attributes which influence the speed at which they can be used. 

### Ergonomics
Ease of aiming, firing the weapon. (Pulling the trigger/directing attacks). Ergonomics is 1/2 of the action economy equation, and is a measure of how quickly and effectively a weapon can be fired once aimed.

### Manueverability
Ease of bringing the weapon up to bear, and getting it roughly aligned with a target. This also guides penalties for using the weapon at close quarters.

## Energy
A measure of the impact that a fired round will have on the target. 

## Rate of Fire
The mechanical ability of a weapon to fire rapidly in short succession. In practice, this allows players to allocate how many shots they wish to fire in a given attack. 

### Types of Fire

#### Single Shot (SS)

#### Manually Operated (MO)

#### Semi-Automatic (SA)

#### Burst (BR)

#### Automatic (FA)
