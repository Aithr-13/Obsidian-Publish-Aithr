Other modules may add complexity, but all rolls boil down to rolling a D100, and assessing if the rolled number is under (a success) or over (a failure) the target number. Difficulty Modifiers \u00b6 There are functionally two, parallel systems in Project Apocrypha to determine how easy or difficult it is to succeed at a given task. In highly-defined enviornments, such as ranged or melee combat, there are specific rules for bonuses and penalties. In less-defined enviornments, sometimes the GM will need to make a gut call on how easy or difficult something should be to succeed at. In these cases, flat modifiers are used. -200: Impossible -100: Herculean -50: Very Hard -40: Hard -30: Difficult -20: Challenging -10: Annoying 0: Neutral +10: Simple +20: Natural +30: Easy +40: Very Easy +50: Instinctive +100: Trivial In almost all situations, the modifiers should be kept between -50 and +50. Generally speaking, the Referee should not bother making a player roll at all when using bonuses approaching 50, as a player should at that point have nearly a 100% chance of succcess. Negative modifiers are used far more often, to indicate doing something under stress, and these should be intuitively decided by the GM unless a codified system is pre-existing. Example: Gasket wants to hop a fence. Doing so requires Athletics + Coordination to succeed. The GM has decided this is a Challenging roll, so a -20 is applied. Gasket\u2019s Athletics (21) + Coordination (32) is 63 total, so he rolls a D100 looking to roll under. He rolls a 51, succeeding, allowing him to jump the fence. Margins of Success \u00b6 In the case of some rolls, determining a Margin of Success is important. In many cases, a simple pass or fail is the only descrimination required, but in others, having some degree of granularity to determine who succeeded more, or how well a party succeeded or failed is helpful. The default determinor for Margin of Success is Target Number - Roll Amount / 10. Practically, unless things are very close, this means that the Referee can simply take the difference in the 10s digit of the target number vs the rolled amount to determine marigins for success. Margins of success are most often important in Opposed rolls, which will be discussed in the below portion. Referees may wish to use Margins of Success as \u201cflavor indicators\u201d to describe how a character succeeded or failed. In the previous example, a Referee may decide that as Gasket had 1 Margin of Success (63-51 = 12, or quickly calculating, 6(0)-5(0) = 1(0)) he made it over the fence without too much trouble, but didn\u2019t sail gracefully over. Opposed Rolls \u00b6 An opposed roll is any roll where one party intends to achieve an effect, while the other wishes to prevent it. This may include persuasion, initmidation, a punch, or a contest of wills. In some cases (active vs passive), the active party will roll their ability or skill, and the passive party must resist the roll. In some cases, this will be resisted with a specific called out defensive profile, or it will be contested with the same roll as the active party\u2019s diceroll. In order for the active party to succeed, their roll must succeed, AND they must either beat the passive party\u2019s margin of success, or the passive party must fail their roll. If both parties fail, nothing happens. For example: Gasket, the active party attempts to force a crime boss\u2019 goon to surrender. He rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (TN 34, + 30 because he\u2019s pointing a gun at them), adding the two ratings for the skill and attribute together, and rolling his D100. The Initimidation skill calls out that the roll may be resisted with Resolve + Cognition (30), unless the target has a skill which applies. The passive party adds these two attributes together and rolls their D100. Gasket rolls a 62, just barely rolling under his own TN, but the goon rolls a 2, rolling significantly under its TN of 30. The goon wins, meaning Gasket has not convinced them to surrender.

When referring to melee combat, characters are considered to be Engaged with each other as soon as one of them moves in to a space which any hostile character could strike with a weapon. The engagement is said to continue until either all parties so engaged are incapacitated, all parties have left the engagement range, or both sides agree to terminate the engagement and cease hostile actions. When referring to ranged combat, characters are considered to be engaged once one party is aiming or firing a weapon at another, and are engaged until one party is either incapacitated, leaves line of sight, or both sides terminate hostile actions. Aiming constitutes an initiation of an engagement. Actions and Reactions \u00b6 Actions \u00b6 Actions are AP expenditures which must take place on the turn of the character using them. They must be used proactively, and can never be used as a reaction. Universal Actions \u00b6 Ready Attack \u00b6 Threaten actions threaten an area around a character. With a firearm or ranged weapon, they ready themselves to shoot whoever enters the threatened area. The effect is similar with a melee weapon. This allows them to make whatever attack they want against a target, rather than being required to use a simple attack. A character must have the Action Potential remaining to Ready an attack, but needn't designate a target, or even execute the attack if they choose instead to take other Reactions. Attack Actions \u00b6 Universal Attack Actions \u00b6 Basic Ranged Attacks \u00b6 Ranged attacks are made against a Target's Avoidance. These provoke a reaction if the defender is using a Ranged weapon, and also always provoke the reaction to dive out of the way, unless the defender is already on the ground. Aim and Fire \u00b6 Aim and Fire actions indicate the pulling of the trigger on a ranged attack with a firearm, or loosing of an attack with a bow. Aim and Fire attacks gain the benefit of the full accuracy of their weapon. Speed = Weapon Ergonomics Mount Weapon \u00b6 This action indicates readying an attack for use, such as bringing a rifle to the shoulder, bringing a pistol up from waist level, or drawing a bowstring. Firearms remain mounted once done so unless the user breaks their stance by running or sprinting, or if rapid fire and recoil causes it to break. Speed = Weapon Manueverability Fire from the Hip \u00b6 This action indicates firing a weapon \u201cintuitively\u201d without aiming, from the hip, or otherwise. The weapon does not gain the advantages of its Accuracy. Speed = Weapon Manueverability. Advanced Ranged Attacks \u00b6 Called Shots \u00b6 Autofire and bursts \u00b6 Basic Melee Attack Actions \u00b6 Melee attacks provoke a reaction from a the defender, which determines how the result is determined. If a defender can defend themselves, with their own weapon, or with their hands, they may roll a test opposed to the Melee attack. The party with the higher Margin of Success wins. If the defender cannot defend themselves against the roll, the Target is protected by Avoidance. Feint \u00b6 Feints are attacks which are designed to trick a defender. Feint attacks are made at a penalty and are not necessarily obvious to the defender as a feint. When successful, feints normal attack, which has limited damage, but increase the difficulty of an opponents counterattack, providing bonus damage. As opposed to the Desperate Parry option in response to a counterattack, Feints allow, in essence, counter-attacking of counter-attacks. Attack \u00b6 Defensive Actions \u00b6 Some actions may be taken to pre-empt incoming attacks. Such actions must be taken on a player's turn. Some of these actions must be unlocked. Defensive Stance: \u00b6 Sacrifices attacks for the remainder of the turn in order to increase defenses. Riposte: \u00b6 Leaves open a venue of attack which can be used to deliver a prepared attack against an enemy. While a defender cannot by default roll a test against Ranged attacks to confront them in the same way as a melee attack, generally, they can increase their Avoidance Rating by increasing their speed, or reducing their exposure. Moving to a sprint, or taking cover can both increase a character's Avoidance Rating. These are generally things that must be done on a character's turn. Reactions \u00b6 Reactions are taken off-turn, in response to being targeted by an attack. They still require the expenditure of AP to use. Ranged Reactions \u00b6 Reactions to Ranged attacks are limited, unless granted by a specific power. These powers often allow a defender to make a defense test against a skill, rather than their Avoidance Rating. Charge Defense \u00b6 When subject to a Charge melee attack, the defender may take a Ranged attack of their choice against the target. The attacker's charge will carry through unless they are stopped outright by the retaliation, and they suffer a dependent on the movement speed of the charging party. Counterfire \u00b6 When subject to a Ranged attack by another Ranged attacker, if the Defender is capable of returning fire, they may try to do so at a penalty. Both the Attacker and Defender may roll against each other's Avoidance Ratings, rolling for injury if it takes place. Target in the Open \u00b6 When a hostile target moves in the open, outside of cover, and not blocked by any obstacles or obstructions, a Ranged weapon user may make an attack against that target at a penalty. Melee Reactions \u00b6 Reactions to Melee attacks are triggered by an incoming melee attack. Counter-attack \u00b6 Attempting to turn the tables on their opponent, the counter-attacker defeats the incoming blow and strikes their opponent. Multiple counter-attacks in a single turn suffer a cumulative penalty of WEAPON SIZE. (Or flat?) Value Proposition: Increase in defense difficulty, but the success might provide damage. Parry \u00b6 Focusing on defense against incoming attack. Successful defense blocks the attack, but defenders who are using a smaller weapon than their attacker must soak Shock damage equal to the size difference. Multiple parries in a single turn suffer a cumulative penalty. - Value Prop: Allows for massive reduction in incoming damage, at a cost. Exploit Opening \u00b6 When given the opportunity (such as someone fleeing from an Engagement) the reacting character may make an attack at a penalty which stacks with the other Melee reaction penalties. Desperate Parry \u00b6 Those who have been counter-attacked may attempt a Desperate Parry, involving one more roll at double difficulty to defend against the counter. A failure inflicts Shock damage as per a parry, as well as the damage that would be suffered from the Counterattack. Universal Reactions \u00b6 Universal reactions may be used in any situation when a defender is aware of the incoming attack. Desperate Dodge \u00b6 The character dives out of the way of an incoming attack, ending up prone up to base movement meters away. They avoid the targeted attack, but must deal with the consequences of being prone. Damage Soak \u00b6 Only enabled by certain abilities, rather than attempt to get out of the way, a player attempts to take the hit straight on their armor, allowing them to potentially change the hit location to one which is more favorable. The Flow of Combat (Initiative and AP) \u00b6 Initiative \u00b6 Action Potential indicates the time events take place. Higher Action Potential is almost always better. Initiative is determined by rolling 2d10, and adding it to the player's Initiative Rating, calculated by taking ACU/10 + VOL/10+ 3 and adding situational modifiers. Players may take actions, spending Action Potential until they are interrupted by the next highest person in Initiative Order. Players can always take at LEAST their Initiative Rating worth of actions before being interrupted. Movement \u00b6 All entities do not expend action potential to move. Rather, they expend action potential to change speeds, and then proceed at that speed as they take other actions (if desired). Changing a level of movement rate (from walking -> running, or running -> sprinting) always costs 2 Action Potential. Characters' total movement is dictated by their CRD/10 (minimum 2). They will move that number of meters per ticks of Action Potential spent walking . Running doubles this speed, and sprinting triples it. This means that for an average, unathletic person (15-20 CRD) they will walk 2m/s, run 4m/s, and sprint at 6m/s. Professional athletes might(30-40 CRD) can achieve speeds significantly greater, walking at 3-4m/s, running at 6-8 m/s, and sprinting at 10-12 m/s, with the top end signifying the limits of human achievement.","title":"Engagments and Threat"},{"location":"101%20Project%20Apocrypha/101.1%20Design%20Documents/101.04%20Combat/#engagments-and-threat","text":"","title":"Engagments and Threat"},{"location":"101%20Project%20Apocrypha/101.1%20Design%20Documents/101.04%20Combat/#engagements","text":"Engagements are one of the core systems of combat in Project Apocrypha.

Limbs are harder to hit, but allow for degrading of a target\u2019s capabilities far more quickly and easily than targeting their Vitality pool alone. Vitality is easier to attack directly, but the pool is larger. Vitality Pool \u00b6 Vitality is the overall measure of a character\u2019s health. In practice, this often means the ability of their nervous system to continue the control of their body. When a character is reduced to 0 vitality, they are typically incapacitated, and begin to bleed to death. PCs and important NPCs may make a Resolve + Endurance roll to continue functioning. Doing so allows them to continue taking actions, but they will suffer bleedout damage as normal. Any further damage taken from an exterior source (notably, NOT Hemmorhage damage) requires an additional save to continue taking actions. This save is Resolve + Endurance - (Current Vitality Pool). Hemmorhage \u00b6 When additional damage is taken in Hemmorhage begins to reduce the target\u2019s Vitality below 0. At the end of each of their turns, the Character in this state\u2019s vitality is applied to all limbs simultaneously. Any limb which is reduced to 0 as a result of this damage is considered crippled as per the usual rules, and when Hemmorhage damage is next applied, instead of applying damage to a 0-health limb, decrease vitality by 1/2 that amount further. A Character or NPC whose Vitality reaches -100% of max Vitality is instantly incapacitated. A character who reaches -200% in any state is dead. Calculating the Vitality Pool \u00b6 The vitality pool is 10 + (END x 2) + RES. ex. Limbs \u00b6 In addition to the Vitality pool, the \u2018health\u2019 of some limbs are tracked. Limbs are either Vitals, or Extremities. States of Limbs \u00b6 Limbs can be Disabled, Maimed, or Destroyed. These states exist at 0, -100%, and -200%. - Disabled limbs create a -25% penalty to any action using that limb. All other actions are at -10 from the pain. - Maimed limbs create a -50% penalty to any action using a limb, and entering this state may create injuries which are permanent to the character. - Destroyed limbs are considered violently amputated, removed or otherwise destroyed. Any actions which require the use of this limb suffer a -100% penalty. Extremeties and Vitals. \u00b6 Extremities are limbs which while important, are not vital (get it?) for life. In normal humans and similar creatures, the limbs are extremities, Torso a Vital, and the head a Critical Location. Extremities \u00b6 In extremities, a Toughness roll must be made whenever a limb becomes maimed to not become immediately incapacitated. Whenever a limb is destroyed, they must make the same save again (harder somehow, codify toughness roll?) Vitals \u00b6 When a vital location is disabled, the character must make a (END + RES) (make this harder somehow) roll to not be immediately killed. Vital locations are considered to be used in all actions for the purposes of calculating injury penalties.They must make a second roll to continue functioning. When a vital location is maimed, the character must make that roll again at a penalty. A destroyed vital location is immediately lethal.

Piercing \u00b6 Piercing damage inflicts 1/2 damage for the purposes of crippling injuries (to limbs, and so on) but inflicts normal damage to the target\u2019s health pool. Crushing \u00b6 Crushing damage inflicts full damage to both crippling limbs, and to the target\u2019s overall health pool. Special \u00b6 Certain abilities may create effects such as \u201cburning\u201d \u201cacidic\" or \u201cfreezing\u201d which modify status effects and damage delivered to the target. These all borrow the damage profile of either Impact, Piercing, or Crushing damage in terms of Health/Limb damage, and add additional effects. Stress \u00b6 Damage which targets the mental state of a target. This may come from failing morale checks, from mental/psionic attacks, or otherwise Players may willingly suffer Stress damage to create momentum in desperate situations.

Maris is in the passenger seat of an MG B convertible with a young Teenage Val, driving through the scorching sun of the Nevada desert. Val is giggling, looking over at Maris. Memory of her father taking her out to drive illegally The view cuts to the desert at night, a full moon high in the sky, clear and cloudless. The moon\u2019s light grows brighter until it washes out everything. Val and James are sitting in a field at Hopkins. \u201cYou can\u2019t live your life in fear of losing out, Val. There will always be experiences you\u2019ll never have. Every single choice closes a million doors, and we don\u2019t even get to make all of them.\u201c \u201cSo what? That\u2019s why you\u2019re not afraid of getting sent off to Somalia to die? Who gives a shit? That\u2019s your profound conclusion. You get to just wave your hand and say \u2018oh, I\u2019m adrift on the sea of fate\u2019? How romantic. Who wrote that? Tolstoy?\u201d James smiles. \u201cHarsh take. I happen to think it\u2019s rooted in raitonalism, not romanticism. No, of course I don\u2019t want to die, but there are worse things than death. Regret. Being trapped in a life worth living, not having a purpose, or worse, forgoing your purpose for fear of doing it wrong. Life isn\u2019t a puzzle you can solve. There is no test at the end, no final score. There is no reward. We all die alone. Staying on the farm was another kind of death. A worse kind, I judged. Time will tell.\u201c \u201cI still think you\u2019re an idiot. There would have been other ways to get here. You didn\u2019t need to sell your soul to the military industrial complex.\u201d Val sighs. He grins. \u201cIt\u2019s that kind of cynicism that ensures that the only people who will want to be in the military will be the worst kind. Morality is important everywhere, especially in a profession where life and death is on the line.\u201d \u201cSo what if you only live to 29? What if you never have kids?\u201d He looks at her sadly. \u201cNo matter how long you or I live, if someone were to ask us on our deathbeds, \u2018What was it like living on Earth?\u201d the only honest answer would be \u201cI don\u2019t know. I passed through it once, but I\u2019ve never really been there. Twenty-five, ninety, or a thousand. It doesn\u2019t matter. Letting that fear keep you back will ruin what time you get.\u201d \u201cSo... you just make gut decisions for everything? It\u2019s all seat of the pants?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s sort of a simplification, but I suppose. The only real thing you can do is look at your options, look at your goals, and look at your morals, and do your level best to square that circle. \u201d \u201cThat seems simplistic.\u201d \u201cAnything but. Who\u2019s a better man - the one who lives a life of virtue but whose virtues are never challenged, or the sinner who strives and fails?\u201d \u201cSo an easy life isn\u2019t worth living?\u201d He beams at her, as if she\u2019s finally gotten it. \u201cIf it\u2019s easy, you\u2019re not doing it right.\u201d She stares in to his eyes, and his shift to the eyes of a mother struggling to deliver a baby. Val delivers a baby in the hallway of 9/11 as the mother is dying from her injuries. Maris sees this from the perspective of the mother. She holds the baby and shushes it. Val cries tears of joy as the hospital chaplain marries them in the street. James is in his uniform, with a duffel bag at his feet. She is the Chaplain saying the words. An outing with the gang at bowling. Val takes Qadir to a baseball game. David reads to her. She reads to David in the Dream. There\u2019s a jumble of memories, from people totally unrelated, from different times, places, and walks of life. Children\u2019s birthdays, funerals, boring lectures, and a shepherd\u2019s life in a field. The beauty of a waterfall, watching the ebb and flow of crashing water and mist. The mist rises and changes as the light catches it. The rainbow-shimmer of the water in the air washes out the view. Maris finds herself in the Wheat Field. There are a crowd of different Val\u2019s around her, some of whom have the ashen hair of Val as a Kindred, and some as a mortal. A woman holding a child. A woman in a flowing white dress, holding a set of scales, with a blindfold. (Justice) A woman in ethereal armor, holding a glowing ethereal sword. (The Noble Herald) A woman in bloody, rusty armor, holding a shifting, scintilating severed head, which changes forms. Her hands drip blood, and a broken sword sits in her right hand, which itself constantly shifts between appeareances. A doctor in scrubs with bloody hands In a naval aviator\u2019s uniform In a straightjacket Dressed like Aisling, as a Tremere As an Anarch As a Sabbat As a Salubri At the center stands a Val with ethereal, shimmering iredescent robes. Her eyes are ablaze with color, the light obscuring most of her face. Her hair drifts as she turns like she\u2019s underwater, following in an impossibly slow arc. There are others, standing, also watching. Qadir, David, Vickers, Isabel, the Individual, in the back corner. Everyone is watching a Val in dark grey combat fatigues and the plate carrier duel the Wayward Hunter. The gleaming ethereal approaches. She almost seems surprised that Maris is here. \u201cHmmph. I did not expect she would be able to manage this so soon. There is so little time for her, and so much she must do. You jeopardize it all.\u201d The Mother: \u201cShe just doesn\u2019t want innocent people to get hurt.\u201d The Salburi: \u201cA dangerous, impossible hope for the Last Daughter of Eve.\u201d The Bloody Handed Herald: \u201cThis Camarilla slave would help the Great Destroyer?\u201d She smirks. If Maris asks where she is, Ethereal Val answers.: \u201cChild, is it not obvious? The Dream, the Twilight, the\u2026 between. What Has Been Made and May Never be Unmade, the refuge. The place where the Demented Seer themselves triumphed over death, not created out of fear, or a pathetic mortal desire for self-preservation, but for a single purpose.\u201d If Maris asks Ethereal Val about the memories she was shown: \u201cThe Dream is a chaotic place. It is easy to become lost, to stream in to others, to lose oneself to the Twilight. She centers herself with those memories, with the cementation of the self as the raging torrent of other swirls around us all. They all lose eventually. She will, one day.\u201d If she asks about manifestations: \u201cShe that could have been, or, she that may still be. Hopes, dreams, fantasies, and impossibilities. Her, as much as she is. Maybe more.\u201c When Maris finishes asking questions of them, the scene begins to fracture. The fight happens a thousand times in rapid speed in front of her. Val sits crosslegged in the dirt. Her eyes take on the blinding glow of Ethereal Val, although she doesn\u2019t seem to notice. Behind her head appears what seems to be a silver halo in the style of an Orthodox or Catholic Icon. She notices Maris. \u201cOh.\u201d She cocks her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you would come. I wasn\u2019t sure if you cared for me too much.\u201d TO DO Look up Persuasion specs Finalize CS for tomorrow","title":"Val's Dream"}]}
